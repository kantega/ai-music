The dollar dropped, the market crashed, we saw the bottom fall
We spent a decade in the dark, staring at the wall
But shake the soot off of your coat and polish up your shoes
We traded in the breadlines for the rhythm and the blues
The chandelier is crystal clear, the velvet rope is down
There’s a brand new kind of magic pulsing through this town.

So forget about your pockets
If they’re empty or they’re full
Tonight we are electric
And the tension is the pull!

Swing it back, swing it high
Watch the troubles pass us by!
We’re dancing on the ashes of the years we lost before
Leaving nothing but some glitz and spilled Gold on the floor!
Yeah, the bank is closed but the bar is open wide

[Instrumental]

Mr. Rockefeller’s humming and the worker’s keeping time
It doesn’t matter who you are when the brass begins to climb
We’re sewing up the patches with a melody so sweet
The only currency we need is moving in the street
The gloom is gone, the lights are on, we're shouting out for more
Forget the dust, we're aiming for the Gold on the floor!

So forget about your pockets
If they’re empty or they’re full
Tonight we are electric
And the tension is the pull!

Swing it back, swing it high
Watch the troubles pass us by!
We’re dancing on the ashes of the years we lost before
Leaving nothing but some glitz and spilled Gold on the floor!
Yeah, the bank is closed but the bar is open wide

We made it through the storm
We made it through the rain
Now the beat is the medicine
To wash away the pain...

Build it up! Build it up! Let’s go!

Swing it back, swing it high
Watch the troubles pass us by!
We’re dancing on the ashes of the years we lost before
Leaving nothing but some glitz and spilled Gold on the floor!
Yeah, the bank is closed but the bar is open wide

Yeah there's gold on the floor...
Dancing 'til our feet are sore.
Don't look back no more!

Jeg er begeistret for electro-swing, så jeg kastet sammen en kjapp tekst for det.
Intensjonen var det motsatte av “The Silence of Snow”; Lage en skikkelig gladlåt.
Dette er en låt som ikke er laget med spesielt omtanke, men likevel ble den overraskende bra.
Det er frustrerende å realisere at det ikke nødvendigvis er noen korrelasjon mellom innsats og kvalitet.
