I heard the chatter in the pit, y'all think I'm sweet?
Wait till I scrape your ugly face off the street.
I ain't playing by the rules, I ain't looking to tame,
I’m here to put a permanent scar on your game.
I’m hunting down the weak, making my selection,
I'm the demon on the track, driving with perfection.
You better say your prayers and ask for protection,
'Cause the Princess is 'bout to teach you a lesson.

You think "Flower Power" means a petal and a bloom?
Nah, it means I put you in a floral-patterned tomb.
You stepping to the Princess? You can't handle the challenge,
I leave you in the dirt with the scraps for you to scavenge.
You choking on the fumes, you just stalling at the start,
I’m driving with a vengeance and a pitch-black heart.
I see the panic in your eyes, I’m tearing you apart,
I’m the devil on the grid, I’m a master of the art.

You studying the meta? Asking Shortcat how?
It's way too late for that, nah he can’t help you now.
I look you in the eyes, yeah I smell the fear,
You ain't going nowhere, the end is near.
I'm gripping on the wheel, poised to attack,
I’m breaking all the limits like a system hack.
Launch boost perfect, leaving flames on the track,
Enjoy the view, bitch, 'cause you'll only see my back.

You begging for an item just to clear the heavy gap,
I hit it completely raw, I don't need the handicap.
You rely on RNG, yeah you hoping for the loot,
I rely on pure skill, I don't need the substitute.
I got the angle right, pure drifting masterclass,
I take the shroomless shortcut right across the grass.
You lookin' for a way to make a desperate pass,
But you ain't got the balls and you ain't got the jazz.

The sky is turning dark, yeah I’m bringing down the pain,
Welcome to the era of the heavy Orange Reign.
I’m coming like a hurricane, I’m coming like a storm,
I’m shattering the record and I’m shattering the norm.
I’m the hardest motherfucker that has ever wore the crown,
I look at every rival and I see a little clown.
I raise the whole damn level, watch the competition drown,
I’m the Empress of the circuit, I’m taking you all down.

I’m lonely at the front, yeah there’s no one in the view,
I’m racing against ghosts, I ain't racing against you.
I’m looking at the map, yeah I’m looking at the gap,
I finished up the race before you saw the final lap.
I wrecked the competition but I won't accept the blame,
I crushed the little heroes that you try so hard to name.
I light the whole circuit with a bright and orange flame,
I’m the undisputed ruler and the master of the game.

I Kantega har vi et sterkt konkurransedrevet forhold til Mario Kart. Her er det Daisy som gyver løs på motstanderne.
Daisy er en karakter i dette spillet som assosieres med fargen oransje, og blir ofte fremstilt som “sassy”.
Et perfekt utgangspunkt for å lage en “diss track”.
Alle versene har 8 linjer hvor de to første rimer, de to neste rimer og de fire siste rimer.
Det var utfordrende å få inn relevant tekst som rimte på denne måten.
Av alle låtene jeg har laget har denne vært den morsomste å skrive teksten til.
